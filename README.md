# Spark SQL Practice
## Practice1
### Overview
This was a class practice from [Databricks SQL Analyst](https://academy.databricks.com/sql-analyst).

In this project, we finished the following tasks using Spark SQL:
- Preview data
- Join tables and create temporary views
- Visualize data

### Recources
All data were provided by the class. There were three CSVs that contained Boston, Chicago, and New York crime data separately. Three tables were uploaded to the database.

### Summary
We cleaned and combined three cities' homicide data and grouped them by month. The bar chart was as follows:

- The greatest number of homicides occurred in September, and there were 70 cases in total.
- Month of April had the lowest homicide cases.
