# Spark_SQL_Practice
## Overview
In this project, we finished the following tasks using Spark SQL:
- Preview data
- Join tables and create temporary views
- Visualize data

## Recources
Three tables were uploaded to the database:
- [crime_data_boston](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Spark_SQL_Practice/blob/main/Resources/crime-data-bos.csv)
- [crime_data_chicago](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Spark_SQL_Practice/blob/main/Resources/crime-data-chi.csv)
- [crime_data_newyork](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Spark_SQL_Practice/blob/main/Resources/crime-data-ny.csv)
